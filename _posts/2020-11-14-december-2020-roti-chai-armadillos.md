Round Two.

Armadillos had the biggest meat raffle ever seen. RCCC members signed up for raffle heartily, with many tickets bought. Surely someone would win something?! Nope, only locals win meat raffle.

Roti Chai delivered. Service was bang on, even with a massive table of 20 also in the restaurant ordering at the same time. Ran out of beers, offered alternate cold beer options. Starters were awesome. Curried were awesome. Ate too much. Ordered refills just because we could. Still canâ€™t believe the banquet price.

The best Indian restaurant in Christchurch. Roll on 2021.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4.3/5  
Food: 4.8/5  
**Total: 9.1/10**

Roti Chai, 29 Ensign St
