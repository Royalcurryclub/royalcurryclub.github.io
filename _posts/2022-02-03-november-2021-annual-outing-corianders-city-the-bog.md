Fantastic day, great craic and good banter.

The plan for the RCCC Annual Outing in November 2021 was simple – a quick 9 holes of golf then off to learn how to make a curry lunch under the experienced eye of the crew at Coriander’s City. Following that, a stretch of the legs on the BeerCycle through the potholed streets and gravel carparks of Christchurch with associated beers along the way, before a civilised dinner at the Afghan Restaurant.

Things started well with a free case of beer (donated by the every resourceful and thirsty JB) and a rainy golf course. Unsurprisingly the winning group of golfers featured our benevolent Maharajah, who of course, is a master of all the manly pursuits.

A quick dash into town and after donning some kitchen hazmat suits, we were treated to the finer points of making a fantastic Lamb Kadai. It is fair to say that after being in a working curry kitchen for only 10 minutes, there is a newfound respect for the hard working staff in the establishments we get to visit. The Coriander’s staff were awesome to listen to and the curries we made were some of the tastiest we’ve had – they definitely warrant a return visit. With a absolutely bellyful of the spicy stuff and beers onboard, we waddled uptown to The Bog to start the BeerCycle hijinks.

The mountains of curry consumed earlier started to slow down the beer drinking temporarily, but thankfully a number of loud party tools had been purchased by enterprising members so insults and hilarity keep everyone entertained until the biking began. It was immediately obvious we were pitted against something resembling a hens party on the other BeerCycle so were cycling for the honour of gentlemen everywhere. About 100m down the road with burning legs, lunch starting to reappear and the race won, we settled into a tour of some of the more “interesting” establishments in Christchurch. Far too soon it was time to retire back to The Bog and continue the fun.

Somewhere out on the rainy pavements or in a dodgy back alley, the Maharajah lost his wallet. This was certainly grounds for winning the Cricketer of the Month award but uncharted territory for the rest of the RCCC wallahs. Fortified by many pints of Guinness at The Bog and with careless disregard for their futures, the award was duly presented. There was also fair bit of RCCC branding applied, and the new RCCC flag attracted some admiring looks from the fairer sex (or so we would like to think). Things got hazy after that but everyone apparently made it home safe as another classic RCCC Outing was concluded.

Roll on November 2022…
