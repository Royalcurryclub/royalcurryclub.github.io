Dinner banquet OTT

Poor punters who were just trying to have a nice quiet family dinner, or the other couple who looked like they were there on a date – 12 noisy blokes entered the establishment and took over (loudly). The menu selection was good, but the food was just ok. The plus side is that they serve goat (always a good sign). The goat saagwala and goat supreme did not have enough oomf. Tandoori platter was very good. The naan could do with more body. Banquet was over the top at $40 pp. Shame. Those that did indulge in the banquet didn’t need to eat breakfast the next day. Service was very good. Baillies Bar was great, as always.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 3.7/5  
Food: 3.4/5  
**Total: 7.1/10**
