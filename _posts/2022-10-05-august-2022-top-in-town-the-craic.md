Shenanigans and Seekh Kabab

August 2022 saw the RCCC lads try out a new venue called Top in Town, and also darken the doorstep of an old favourite boozer, The Craic, which is handily placed across the road from the curry house. The Maharajah had gone all fundamentalist again and selected a dry venue for dinner so pre-dinner drinks had certain necessity and urgency about them. An overly friendly local who was three sheets to the wind tried to petition the club to allow a more diverse membership but she was rebuffed after drinking from several beer glasses and offering hers in return. Only one member was brave enough to sample her liquid wares – MW took one for the team – well done that man! The Scream Witch will go down in RCCC lore as one of the most memorable characters we’ve met so far.

Then it was across the road to Top in Town which featured a large buffet section that is sadly only open weekends so it was the standard menu for us. While there was a focus on authentic Hyderabadi cuisine there were also a fair few Schezwan options for an Indo-Chinese fusion experience. The seekh kabab was called out by one member as the best in Christchurch which is high praise given the number of visitations in the 7 year reign of the RCCC. The other starters were also “on fire” as the kids say but the consensus for the mains was that they were just ok. The better prepared members had armed themselves with illicit libations to be consumed while furtive glances were cast across the restaurant. Sadly it was rather bereft of other patrons which may be a sign of other customers only visiting once.

After dinner it was back to The Craic where the Scream Witch had made some new friends so we were left alone to sink a few cold ones. The visitation concluded on a high note with dates locked in for annual RCCC Summer Sounds Trip in November – fish beware!
