Who doesn’t like a good goat curry?

Restaurant did well to cope with 14 of us when the booking was only for 9. Despite only about half of the listed beers being available and the early confusion as to whether or not we could have some members enjoy the banquet option, the experience was generally ok. The starters, were nothing to write home about, the curries much more to our liking. Who doesn’t like a good goat curry? Torenhof was trumped by Moon Under Water for the pre/post meal drink. MVP of the night was Rob; well done on finishing the indian hot vindaloo and raising some cash for a great cause!
