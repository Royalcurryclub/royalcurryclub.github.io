Extensive menu!

The curries were delicious, with the Baltic being certified as authentic. Service was good. Lack of cheese and garlic naan and dry samosa scored them down â€“ fix those things and they could climb. Blow me away with more never seen before items on the menu + nail them to get a 5. As always the company and banter scores 6!

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 3.7/5  
Food: 3.7/5  
**Total: 7.4/10**
