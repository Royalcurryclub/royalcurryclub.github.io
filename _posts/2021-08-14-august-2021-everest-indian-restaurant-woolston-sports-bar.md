Momo heaven.

Good turn out early on at the friendly Woolston Sports Bar for pints of DB Draught and games of pool.

Everest Indian Restaurant brought flashbacks of the Nilesh Palace visitation the same month two years prior, a small, mostly takeout focus place (could do with a clean and spruce up) with no alcohol license. This time, quick thinking from JB and MD resulted in a couple of boxes of Kingfisher presenting themselves at each end of the table. Service was understandably slow, but they were relaxed, mostly remembered who had ordered what, and got all the food out in one go.

Food was excellent, from the onion bahjee to the garlic naan and the cashew chicken (highly recommended by the fellow Indian countryman at the liquor shop next door). The mixed platter was spot on, naan was super light and crisp, and the Nepalese goat (so they say…) curry was full of flavour. The wholemeal Roti were the best had in a long while; the chicken momos amazing – is like a Indian Curry in a deep fried dumpling.

Pint of Guinness at the Oak n’ Ferry with a couple of the locals propped up by the bar topped the night off.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4.3/5  
Food: 3.6/5  
**Total: 7.9/10**
