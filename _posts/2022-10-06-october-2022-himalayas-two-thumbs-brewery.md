Blazers and Back to an Old Favourite

At the 2015 ICC World Cup, a couple of cricket tragics happened upon a pair of dapper gentlemen in the crowd and started chatting. The conversation is long forgotten but what stuck in the mind was the power and presence that a well turned out fellow in a blazer commands. And so seven tumultuous years later, club devoted to cricket and curry (and other things) has been born and flourished. And, now those cricket tragics are finally going to be rocking RCCC Blazers!

A special Blazer ceremony with its own special handshake took place at the Two Thumbs Brewery. The freshly warranted RCCC wagon was adorned with blazer clad beefcakes and ladies within a 100 metres felt weak at the knees. There were even whispers of the Blazers possibly inspiring some afterhours horizontal refreshment…

The RCCC Wolf Pack then decamped to Himalayas where stragglers were awarded blazers and the serious business of curry munching began. Goat was a popular order of the day (as it always is). Service was prompt and efficient and the food rated an incredible 4.8/5. Himalayas always delivers a fantastic evening and this visitation was no exception. Quote of the night goes to JB: Just like it’s the jacket that surrounds the man that makes the man, it was the onion bhaji and peshwari naan that surrounds the biryani that made this a 5 star effort from start to finish.

The next challenge is to get a picture of the RCCC up on the wall at Himalayas along with past prime ministers and other dignitaries. We’ve got the blazers so nothing can stop us now!

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4.5/5  
Food: 4.8/5  
Total: 9.3/10
