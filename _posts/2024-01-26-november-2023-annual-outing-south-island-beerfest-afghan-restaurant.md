Finifugal Fun in the Sun.

When it comes to the traditional November annual outing, three things are mandatory: beer, curry and good times. The 2023 edition had all three in absolute spades and its going to be pretty hard to top. Things kicked off in the genteel surroundings of Ilam Homestead with the South Island Beerfest. After some tent erection exercises run in typically efficient fashion by HRH Maharajah to get close to the bushes for a possible quiet siesta later, the serious business of beer menu perusal began. Knowing the RCCC was in residence, Chilli beer was one of the options and was a very popular choice amongst RCCC members who looked magnificent in their number ones for the occasion. We were certainly the best dressed in attendance as evidenced by the many photos floating around social media, and were fending off frisky frolic offers all day….probably.

After working our way through most of the beers on offer and finding a couple absolute gems – Lolly Cake Pastry Stout anyone, it was time to mob up and head across town for dinner. A quick diversion via Woodstock Addington was on the cards keep the whistles wet and then it was onto the random craziness of the Afghan Restaurant. Along the way a new member was found – Canadian Spice Scout Ali who is promising to set up a new RCCC chapter on our steady push for world domination.

Service was both comically unique and entertaining as usual, but somehow the food always arrives and is without fail, amazing, 5 out of 5 on the score charts. No doubt the copious amounts of the amber ales onboard and the flames emanating from the kitchen kept us interested until skewers of tasty mystery meat and some green stuff arrived. Post dinner drinks and not very skillful pool were conducted back at the Woodstock place to round out the evening.

Another resounding annual outing success, with lots of lies told, beers discovered, and new friends made.

Perfect.

Service: 4.5/5
