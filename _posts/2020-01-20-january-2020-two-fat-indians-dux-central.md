Taken to heaven…?

After a few expensive beers at Dux Central, the RCCC settled in at the Two Fat Indians restaurant, a full 12 months after their last visit.  
The Lamb La-Jawb is described as “Perfected on the streets of Hyderabad where it is cooked with fenugreek leaves, green chillies and hot spices. If you enjoy it hot then don’t go past this dish”. A medium was ordered and there was relief that a hot wasn’t, quite a turnaround from 12 months ago. Another member took the option of being “taken to heaven” as it sounded tempting in the menu, which involved paying additional for matched rice and a naan of the chefs recommendation – it was nice, but not heavenly and not worth the price premium.  
Service was below par, and the restaurant apologised as we were paying at the end of the meal. Multiple attempts to take beer order as they kept finding out they didn’t have stock of A, then none of B either and then just arrived with beer C without confirming anyone wanted that one was a shame.

Unexpectedly the best value that night was actually the $18 can of Im-peach-mint craft beer at Dux!

Post meal drinks were at the Little Fiddle on the Terrace where pints of Guinness soothed several alimentary canals.
