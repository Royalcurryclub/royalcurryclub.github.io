Memorable evening

It was the RCCC annual mid-winter Secret Santa outing this month, kicked off with $6 pints of Guinness at the Bog. It was a strong turnout and great to see a couple of the longer standing members make an appearance after a period of absence!

With over a dozen of us taking over the restaurant, the establishment did well to look after us all. Service was excellent, attentive, friendly and certainly understanding after Mr D accidentally knocked a tray fully laden with food out of the waitressâ€™ hands! The goat choice of the month, mostly in kadai and madras forms supported by great onion bhajis, naans, and special platters.

A noticeable lift in the quality of the Secret Santa gifts this year as the members put in a decent effort to ensure that the gifts had an Indian connection. Good laughs all round.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4.0/5  
Food: 4.3/5  
**Total: 8.3/10**
