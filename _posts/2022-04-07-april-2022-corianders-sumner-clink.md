Blazers, Birthdays and Bloody Good Laughs.

A thirsty group of RCCC gentlemen descended on the salty environs of Sumner in early April 2022 and kicked things off in the traditional beery fashion at Clink.

Then it was onto the warm curry embrace of Coriander’s Sumner for a double birthday celebration. The table looked resplendent in ribbons and helium filled balloons (more about those later), in the appropriate Indian colours. Well Done TK for raising the bar for future birthday celebrants. Adding to range of branded RCCC fashion was discussed, with plan to get custom made blazers, kicked off. Future formal RCCC events are going to be even more memorable wearing these unmissable bits of kit.

The great selection of locally brewed Eruption Brewing beers was noted but tradition demanded our hydration was provided by Kingfisher as usual. The service was very attentive with the staff full of enthusiasm and they certainly got into spirit of the occasion, by offering a free main for our Birthday Lads (TK and MW). The wait time for food was also very short considering we were a large group of 12 so kudos to the staff. Both Birthday Lads duly imbibed the customary vindaloo and despite wiping of the brow with a naan after, the offering was pronounced to be the most forgiving vindaloo ever. A number of gentlemen chose the banquet, which was pronounced to be tasty and great value for money too.

After a couple beers had been had, the aforementioned balloons were then put to good use and with much hilarity as we Followed the Yellow Brick Road. And finally, another trophy was added to the RCCC cabinet this month – the FOMO trophy. This writer isn’t too sure on the criteria for winning this distinctive objet d’art, but will no doubt, learn soon. For his keenness to add to the monthly award miserly, TK was awarded both the CotM and the FOMO trophies. A couple of still thirsty members then retired back to Clink to further toast good health and happiness to the Birthday Lads – Slàinte!
