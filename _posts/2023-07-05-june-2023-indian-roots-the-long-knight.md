While a couple of our roving curry reporters canvassed future options from the far-flung regions of Oamaru (limited) and Dubrovnik (mixed), the rest of the Merry Munchers descended on Indian Roots in Halswell. Since our last visit in May 2021, it had undergone a change of ownership and name – what would the new guise hold for our second visitation? But first it was to the Long Knight for supping ales and telling tall tales. Hoorah to those fellows who dressed up in RCCC blazers, they certainly had the slightly dodgy bar maidens weak at the knees and brought a touch of class to the place.

Initial impressions of the rebranded restaurant were favourable with the place packed with punters and the extensive menu punctuated with personal touches from the new proprietors. With the OG Banquet Bro MR in town and looking resplendent in his newly awarded RCCC blazer, banquet negotiations kicked off in earnest while the Kingfisher order was taken by the very attentive staff. The Lassi Lads took preparations for Dry July to a new level by starting a month early but to be fair, the lassis did look rather good. Despite best intentions, the service was slow thanks to the very busy restaurant which is a good sign for quality of the curry but a bad sign for eating before 8pm. Once the curries arrived it was confirmed our suspicions that the superb curry was huge drawcard for local people and was well worth the wait. Chicken Changeezi was on point and the goat curry was close to perfection only lacking a bit of volume.

So definitely a place we would go back to – fingers crossed for a less busy night next time.
