Across the Border and Eating like a Local.

The magnificent gentlemen of the RCCC broke with tradition by crossing the culinary border in May 2022. While we have established a firm liking for Afghani cuisine, this was the first time we ventured to the land where fertile plains rise up to become the highest mountains on the planet – Nepal. But first it was to time to get reacquainted with Bills Bar and Bistro which we last visited 5 years ago. Pints were sunk and plans were hatched to return for the Mickey Rat’s karaoke after dinner.

Despite covid enforced absences depleting the RCCC ranks, the restaurant staff were very keen to please the small but esteemed group of curry aficionados. Free poppadoms were duly rolled out and the intriguing offer of a special Nepalese dish, not on the menu, was floated. The always popular choice of goat was also on the menu as well as some other fan favourites. The service was noted to be very attentive and keen to impress upon us the differences between the usual Indian fare and the superior Nepalese cuisine on offer. We learnt that you don’t dip your naan in Nepal although old habits die hard, and sometime you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.

With bellies full and the rules of Nepalese ordering etiquette firming understood, the visitation was pronounced a success. It is certainly a fun and interesting alternative to a normal curry house. The CotM and the FOMO trophies were awarded to IC for unknown sins committed and the RCCC members wandered back into the night for further festivities.
