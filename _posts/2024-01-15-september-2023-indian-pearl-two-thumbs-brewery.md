Birthday Bonanza with Jimbro.

With the 2023 RWC just about to start and Spring starting to…spring, the Maharajah and his Merry Band of RCCC’ers decamped to Two Thumbs Brewery to start the September shenanigans. We had mercurial member RH to put in a comet-like appearance, later there was birthday cake and then even lady at RCCC! Truely, one for the ages.

Indian Pearl has been a popular venue over the year with several formal visitations and many a lunchtime visit too. Once again Indian Pearl showed why it is a top venue. The twins pulled in extra staff to cope with our large booking, all orders were taken and delivered without issue, and everyone kept well hydrated of course. Curry score was a bit down on previous visits but maybe this was due to the distraction of birthday cake later. There was also a contingent of brewers who rocked up – sadly without any product, but we won’t hold that against them, too much, which also may have been a distraction from the curry.  
None of this got in the way of another excellent visitation made even sweeter by Birthday Boy Jimbro shouting for the dinner! In addition, Mrs Jimbro showed up and provided literally the icing on the cake (and of course a cake) to round out a memorable evening.

Sadly, the post dinner drinks at Two Thumbs were a bit curtailed with the pub closing an hour earlier than advertised, even with full tables of punters still supping the golden sauce. Would have been great to carry on the celebrations but sadly, not to be. Next time…
