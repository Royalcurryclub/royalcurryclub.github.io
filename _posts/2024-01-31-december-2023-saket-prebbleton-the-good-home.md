Only the Chosen Few.

With a number of RCCC members recuperating, hiding or just plain shirking their first Thursday of the month duty to currydom, a select crowd of fine gentlemen assembled at the Good Home to get the December visitation under way. This surely ranks as the shortest gap between visitations given we had visited the leafy surrounds of Prebbleton mere months before. However, our newly deputised Maraharajah EK, had deemed it so, so as loyal subjects we followed. For those good keen men who did pitch, their reward was a glorious afternoon in the sun with lovely pints to get things started.

Scores from previous visitation were a bit middling so it would be telling if the visit and a critique from the most esteemed Royal Curry Club of Christchurch had delivered a kick to the proverbial and improved things. The Banquet Bros started off the action and for first time in a while, they were defeated by the volume on offer, so certainty that aspect had been improved. The lamb kadhai was given a perfect 10 out of 10 rating which is very high praise indeed and another sign of improvements since our last visit. And finally, the service was amazing without being overzealous and there was no curry lottery when the food arrived. So safe to say that Saket Prebbleton has vastly improved its game and is well worthy of another visit soon.

Service: 4.7/5

Food: 4.7/5
