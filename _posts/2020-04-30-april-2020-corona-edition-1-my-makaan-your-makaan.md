\*Insert Corona pun here\*

The 63rd RCCC meeting was under threat this month by the global pandemic pandemonium as RCCC members, along with the rest of the country, were restricted to their homes. Into week two of level 4 lockdown, and fully stocked up on toilet paper, the circulating memes were beginning to wear off, so a virtual RCCC meet was convened by the Maharaja, with members dusting off their cookbooks to produce their own curry masterpiece.

The virtual gathering was fantastic, with members in full club regalia. Confessions were made where other more talented chefs at the home kitchen produced presented masterpieces, and tips on how to survive lockdown shared as we negotiated the dodgy quality video call.

As the enforced home stay regime is here to stay for an indeterminate time, scores may or not be influenced by members’ wish to keep the peace at home or avoid jeopardising opportunities for intimacy…

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 3.0/5  
Food: 4.3/5  
**Total: 7.3/10**
