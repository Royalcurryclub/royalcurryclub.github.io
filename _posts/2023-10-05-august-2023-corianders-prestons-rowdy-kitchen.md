Top Service and a Definite Revisit.

With the Maharajah on an overseas membership drive/spending the RCCC slush fund, the RCCC decamped to the leafy environs of Prestons to see if the fuss about the new Corianders, was justified. In the usual fashion there were some warm-up bevvies to be dealt with and these were duly imbibed at Rowdy Kitchen. As the names suggests, it was very busy, though it seems the cost-of-living crisis has bypassed Prestons, since the $15.50 pints were being chugged down with not care in the world.

The curry house was sadly not as busy as the pub, but we soon learnt this was by no means an indictment on the curry or the service. We were immediately greeted with the always popular and good for scores, free appetisers including the absolutely amazing tandoor kebab. There was further great feedback on the food throughout with the naan being “to die for” and the mushroom dopayaza “brilliant”. What stands out most though, is the service. The right curry went to the right person at the right time AND we had lots of good fun with the staff. We, of course, had to tell the lore of the RCCC from way back when, some of it may have even been true.

The Maharajah was unanimously awarded the FOMO trophy for not wearing his blazer while water-skiing as well as other transgressions. There were later attempts to re-award the trophy to others but only the Raj can do that, and with him away this month, the original award stands. Unfortunately, Rowdy Kitchen was closing just as we rolled back, so post curry drinks were aborted and we disappeared into the night. We’ll definitely be back at Corianders Prestons and look forward to the excellent curry and chats with Davindha and the team again.
