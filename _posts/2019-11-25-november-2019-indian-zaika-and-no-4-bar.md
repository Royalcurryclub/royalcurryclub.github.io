BYO night…!

It was a great evening for pre-drinks at No. 4’s outdoor patio area, and to hear about RCCC members’ recent trips away. After learning about Zimbabwe’s multiple commercial transaction models, we made our way around the corner to this month’s main attraction: Indian Zaika.

It was BYO for this month, and there were a few discontent whispers about “Pepper Tree” January 2016 incident all over again, but the BYO turned out to be a hit as Indian Zaika is just across the road from Fresh Choice Merivale which has an amazing selection of craft beers. It is fair to say that it took the RCCC members longer to choose their beers than it does for any of their missus’s to put their make-up on; there was in depth discussions on the appropriate beer to match with a curry.

The curry selection was good and the curries themselves were very tasty but Indian Zaika was let down by the service as it took ages for the orders to come out and one lost altogether. This was a shame as the service was friendly and they did make amends later. The Banquet Bro’s had to make do with the mixed platter for two; the samosas not as heavy as others have been in the past and quite enjoyable. Notable mentions for the HOT as advertised Jalfrezi, the prawn Malabari, the wide selection of vegetarian options, the naan breads and the menus’ design!

For those local RCCC members, a return will be on the cards.
