Spicy Goat.

Mid-winter secret Santa session back at Saket and Bailies barâ€¦some were butt hurt with their shitty secret santa gifts, others were butt hurt by the fucking hot spicy goat curries.

The starters were top notch, delicious spices and very tasty. The goat supreme (hot) lived up to expectations firstly in creating a good bead of sweat on the brow and a case of the sniffles when consumed, and then poisoning the marital bed. I would say it was an all round success. The secret Santa theme this year was drinking vessels. The Indian coffee making device and cognac glass were popular and went through many hands. Not so popular was the used kids smurf drinking bottle with teeth marks in the lid and distorted bottom from going through the dishwasher once too many times.

The Kilkenney from Baillies Bar went down well.
