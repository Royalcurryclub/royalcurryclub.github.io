Indian Fusion.

The February visitation was recommendation from the FTCC (First Thursday Curry Club) who we had the pleasure of meeting in January. First up it was off 12 Bar to wet the whistle and listen to some live music. The music unfortunately wasn’t very good but the excellent selection of cold beer made up for that.

Delhi 6 has quite a varied menu with North Indian, Indo Chinese and Thai all catered for, although most of the RCCC stuck to the Indian theme. The samosas and the onion bhaji were popular starters and pronounced to be exceptionally tasty and good value too. The always requested Jalfrezi also got very good marks for taste and spiciness and was inhaled with great gusto as was the goat which proved to be another popular choice. The chicken 65 also got a shout out. Worth remembering that Delhi 6 do a free delivery service if you spend more than $40, well worth checking out again.

For many transgressions of the Mararajahs many arbitrary rules, MW was awarded both the CoTM and FOMO trophies – a feat henceforth known as the Dave Allen combo. A couple stalwarts returned to 12 Bar to see if the music had improved. It hadn’t, but the beers were still delightfully cold and refreshing!
