Welcome to Our Future.

Maybe it was a delayed Festive Season hangover or a glitch in the matrix, but the January 2023 visitation will go down as one of the strangest ones yet. First it was off to Craft Embassy to suck down some loud mouth juice and steel oneself for the return to work in a couple days.

After checking out decor and menu in the newly open restaurant, things took a decidedly Twilight Zone-esque turn when we discovered the FTCC (First Thursday Curry Club) were in attendance too. They’ve been around for 25 years and we were simply amazed that we’d not run into these good buggers before. They looked in pretty good nick which proves curry and beers is good for you. Here is to their good health and hoping the RCCC goes that long!

Unfortunately, the hilarity and horror of meeting an older version of ourselves didn’t distract from the fact that the new City branch isn’t a patch on the original. So it’s unlikely we’ll be back, but some of the menu options including the Stuffed Yorkies did sound appealing though and an appropriate amount of ring sting was reported the following day, so never say never…

Amongst all the admiring glances at RCCC blazers and pounding of pints, the trophies came out. For his overzealous attempt to make new friends by handing over the RCCC silverware, TK was a worthy CoTM winner.
