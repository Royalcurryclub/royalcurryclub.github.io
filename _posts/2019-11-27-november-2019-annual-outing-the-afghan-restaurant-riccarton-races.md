Never disappointed.

The RCCC 2019 Annual Outing was a gloriously sunny afternoon spent at the Riccarton Race Course Grand National Lawn, betting and cheering on the fillies. The RCCC members presented well in the new club colours, and made the most of the surprisingly cheap bar. After the last race, RCCC members soaked up the remaining atmosphere before making their separate ways to Lincoln Road, reconvening at Morrell and Co.

After further refreshment, it was time for the short walk to The Afghan Restaurant. For the uninitiated, you donâ€™t go to this fine establishment for the traditional restaurant table service, you go there for the hospitality and amazing food. The menus are meaningless; simply queue up at the door then find a free table, helping yourself to plates and cutlery and be called over to collect platters of delicious kebabs, rice, curry and salad. We managed to secure a spot that seated all of us and waited in anticipation for what we would have for dinner, and were not disappointed.  
The day was rounded off with a few pints of Guinness and games of pool at Sullivans before the remaining members signed-off on another successful RCCC annual outing.

Roll on the 2020 edition!
