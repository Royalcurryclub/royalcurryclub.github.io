Missing Curry House and Missing Fish

One of the highlights of the year is the annual RCCC November trip. The Corona years had forced recent November events to be closer to home affairs, but finally it was time go back to the Sounds after 4 long years away. In the lead up to the trip, things started badly, first a jet ski injury then got worse with a touch rugby injury, but those plucky and brave RCCC lads vowed to fight on. Or at least vowed to drink the beers of the fallen curry munchers. It was the least we could do…

After an adventure style quiz and race through the highways and byways of Canterbury and Marlborough there was a minor disarray on arrival in Picton. Its seems since our last visit that the chosen establishment had folded and was now a bare patch of land. Thankfully the only other curry house in Picton was close by, so onto Pinch of Spice. Once the Mararajah dished out the new RCCC kit (only a year late) the hungry horde got down to business. Despite the spicing being a bit inconsistent – Vindaloo was way too mild but Jalfrezi on the hotter side, the quick and friendly service was much appreciated. The garlic naan singled out as very good too. The naans were helping soak up the lagers which for some of the more lubricated members, were going down like home-sick moles. As the beers flowed, conversation turned for fish slaying as the much-awaited fishing charter loomed on the Saturday – reputations were on the line, who would take prize for biggest fish??With curry filled bellies and tired from lugging mountains of liquid refreshment and some food down the track to the bach, Thursday was closed out in the appropriate manner with quiet drinks on the deck.

The next day started with a RCCC flag raising and the beers were soon being opened after a hearty breakfast. The tennis court was turned into a cricket pitch and a long game with even longer stories began with breaks for beers and ball finding. A number of lost balls enforced a long break while more supplies were sourced from Picton and some of the more energetic members elected to burn off the beers and curry with long bush walk round the bays back to Picton. Other wiser heads elected to prop up a deck chair on the beach, soak up the views and revel in the serenity. Fishing day aka Saturday was started with yet another flag raising, and we were soon aboard the charter boat for hour long run out to the hopefully fishy depths. First, best, most and biggest fish were of course caught by the Maharajah which sparked some scandalous whispers of outside interference in the competition. Of course, these were rapidly shutdown with tales of mutinous sailors falling out of windows from the boats in these parts…

A lack of fish slayed was definitely noticed, a stark difference from 4 years ago but a couple beers with other fine gentlemen on a glorious day on the crystal clear Sounds waters soothed the injured pride of many. A fine weekend was perfectly rounded up by watching the wahine of the Black Ferns win a pulsating final to lift the Womans Rugby World Cup. Another epic RCCC holiday concluded – roll on November 2023.
