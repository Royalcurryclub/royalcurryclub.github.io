Turn up the heat.

A good number of us made it for the first outing of 2019 and great to check out the new EntX complex where our visitation this month was centred.

The menu was diverse and unique with an emphasis on Indian street food, it was spoilt though by a butter chicken (the missionary position of curries, which I suppose they need to have on the menu in order to drag in namby pambies and take their money). The Banquet Bros were not reacquainted this month as the options available were over priced for what they included. The ordered food was, however, delicious, especially the Lamb Shank Nihari, Lamb Railway-Wala and Lamb La-Jawab. The poppadoms courtesy of the house was appreciated, and the suggested rice/naan match combinations for each dish was a nice touch. The food was only let down by a lack of heat; very mild all round even with orders of medium/hot. Several members are keen to return and check out the other curries and the Street Food side of the menu sometime in the near future.

The only slight minor draw back about the venue is the over sterile decor and the (lack of) atmosphere, not helped by the restaurant being situated near the new EntX foodcourt.

It was a ‘take your dad’ to curry club night and Mr D Snr enjoyed the curry and beer, which went down very well with the convincing win by the Black Caps over the Sri-Lankans.
