Worth the asking price?

Very strong turn out for the RCCC this month, and it was great to have 1st floor of the restaurant to ourselves. The Three Boys cardamom and ginger wheat beers were well received and very refreshing. The menu was limited, so most members threw caution to the wind and elected to go with the banquet option. The starters were good, the (refillable) mains ok, the kerela parotta and red rice were an interesting change to the usual fare. The service was very friendly – we enjoyed the chap who came to say good bye at the end of his shift! Overall, a just ok experience – the food was good, but we left with a feeling of having been ripped off as it wasn’t worth the asking price.
