Thumbs up.

Two thumbs on tap at Welles St – good stuff.

At Punjabwalla, the banquet was a feast; best don’t eat anything for 48 hours before going in. The starters were great and the mains were just ok. The desserts, which is something I don’t ever go for, were actually quite good. The mushy carrot cake stuff was top notch. The combo is good for a feast.
