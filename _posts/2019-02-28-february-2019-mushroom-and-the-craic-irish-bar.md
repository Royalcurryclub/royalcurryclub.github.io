Read the small print…

Mix bag this month with a GrabOne deal frustration. Pretty much every member bought a GrabOne voucher but we were only allowed to use one of them for the booking, no matter how hard we begged/tried to convince them otherwise, they did not allow is to use more than one voucher. It’s a shame they couldn’t be more flexible on that front. Having said that, the service managed to deal with the fact that there was a large number of grumpy curry aficionados. There was no banquet menu option – queue more disappointment. The bhajis were good, garlic naans very good, good meat to curry ratio. Lahori Lamb Curry tasty, but was supposed to have included cheekpeas, but actually came with chickpeas; the goat curry was also very tasty. One universal comment was that all curries were very mild, even for those that actually ordered hot – queue more disappointment. General consensus was that it wasn’t overly special, but we would all visit again (at the very least to use our GrabOne vouchers!)

It was a continuation of ‘bring your dad to curry club’ with a big ups to Mr B who came all the way over from the UK especially for a curry.

Pre and post curry pints of Guinness and Kilkenny at the Craic were many and thoroughly enjoyed.
