Great Banquet.

January RCCC visitations used to be a quiet affair, attended only by those few members whose family had kicked them out of the house after too much time together over the holidays. This month there was a bumper turnout of 11 members looking to get out of the house and enjoy a return to one of our favourite curry establishments – Mumbaiwala.

Our resident procurement master and founding member of the Banquet Bros took over ordering for the full table and extracted maximum value for money. There is a always a great atmosphere at Mumbaiwala and the variety of food on offer pleases the palate. The Tendulkar beer rated a mention as being memorable too.

In another ground breaking awarding of the Cricketer of the Month, RT and MD repeated their heroics from the previous month, by once again taking home the big prize. Nominations for the February COTM will no doubt be keenly contested. Pre and post drinks were at the every popular, Craft Embassy.

Adieu MR – So long, and thanks for all the Banquets!
