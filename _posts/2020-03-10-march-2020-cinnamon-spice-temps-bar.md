Chicken 65?

After the first couple of 2020 visitations fell on awkward dates, this month the RCCC headed out to Hornby.

A good number met at Temps Bar for pre-drinks. A proper boozer with friendly locals. Shout out to Cory who shared a few yarns over a DB Export Gold quart before heading out on a date night.

Now ready for the main event, we walked around the corner to Cinnamon Spice. A little gem of a place that is completely unassuming from the outside; you wouldn’t necessarily pick it based on appearances, but as we know, appearances can be deceiving. With a good selection of curries beyond the traditional Christchurch menus considered, food and beer orders were placed with the very approachable waitress. She was excellent at remembering dishes, keeping the beer flowing, splitting the bills and even added to the banter, top marks for service.

The food was flavoursome and the quantities very generous. The Chicken Patiyala – “Garnished With Chopped Coriander And Egg Omelette” – was significant and almost defeated a couple of the RCCC members. The mixed platter was great value; special mention for moist and light bhajis and samosas; the hot Balti Dansak chicken portion size was significant and flavourful, the roti crisp and dripping in butter.

An instant classic. Great service, great food and plenty of it. Would definitely visit again.
