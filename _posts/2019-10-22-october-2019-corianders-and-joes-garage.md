Birthday Cake Surprise

After pre-drinks at Joe’s Garage, 11 RCCC members convened at Coriander’s for curry and more beers. Mr D was modelling the latest in fashion from India, which was a gift of a skirt that his work colleagues from India had given him – and there was a bit of skirt envy from a couple of the RCCC members. The Chicken Tikka starter came out sizzling and was tasty. The Coriander’s Platter for two was well received; the samosas, onion bhajis, chicken seekh kebabs, lamb chops and two chicken tikka pieces were very flavorful and polished of at speed. The RCCC would recommend the Coriander’s Platter which did sizzle over the Sizzling Tandoori Platter, which didn’t. The mains were all healthy portion sizes, the Murg Kadai, Mushroom Masala and received good reviews, and the Chicken Jalfrezee was raved about by the RCCC’s own Jalfrezee connoisseur. There was an order mixup – lamb and chicken varieties were switched. Still very tasty, and when highlighted, handled very well by the staff. Good atmosphere, and great fun when neighbouring table shared their father’s birthday cake!
