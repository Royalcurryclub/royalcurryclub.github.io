Curry Secret Santa.

With the Christmas holidays long gone and summer in full swing, the fabulous RCCC gentlemen and their <s>flying</s> driving machine (aka the RCCC Chariot) decamped to the seaside. First up was the Black Pearl Tavern where a very decent turnout of members shot the breeze and sank some delightful 3 Boys IPA pints. Cricket and blazers dominated the conversation, hopefully there will be a RCCC event in the future, with both.

Then it was time for the inaugural visitation of Chilli Flakes. As this is the local of esteemed member, IC, expectations were high. Initial impressions were favourable with Jalfrezi on the menu and racy pictures on the walls. The ordering of the curry however was a bit chaotic, with the fast talking waiter hell-bent on banquets for everyone, despite some orders being the non-banquet variety. This turned into quite the curry Secret Santa session with Chicken Jalfrezi being lamb and something mushroom definitely not mushroom. The portions were however generous, and of a high standard for refined RCCC palates. The banquets were also singled out for high praise by members that ordered them (and some that didn’t), so plates were empty by the end of the night.

Several members went back to the menu and ordered what can only be described as pudding C&amp;B. It was very tasty by all accounts, if a little salty. After some talk of going back to the pub, nothing eventuated but everyone was certainly satisfied with their meal and the general entertainment of participating in the curry version of lucky dip. A certain member committed yet another faux pas by forgetting the COTM trophy at home – tut tut, must do better next time…
