March Madness.

The Maharajah decreed that the March visitation would take place at the new Saket Prebbleton which was a mere stagger and a couple farts from the Raj palace. There was the serious business of a couple birthdays vidaloos to be enjoyed/endured and a special wedding vindaloo for MW to celebrate his upcoming nuptials. But first it was time to relax in the summer sun at the Good Home while tall tales of motorcycle madness machismo were told and refreshing pints were sunk.

Saket in Edgeware is a much loved and and oft visited establishment so it was with great interest that we venutured inside to see how the new Saket measured up. The extensive menu looked pretty much the same which is no bad thing. The Maharajah’s vindool was ordered Kiwi Hot but was no match for his glorious tastebuds with no sweating or runny nose noted, such is his prowess. The Jalfrezi was also a bit underspiced. Staff were really friendly and attentive and it was nice to have a new member join the RCCC – Welcome JG.

The whereabouts and winners of the FOMO and CoTM trophies are lost to the mists of time but the 11 magnificent gentlement of the RCCC had a great time soaking up the sun and curries. Another enjoyable visitation done.
