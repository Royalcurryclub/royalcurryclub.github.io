Wolf Packs and New Traditions

As December 2022 rolled over and the long-awaited summer break beckoned for many, the hot topic of conversation wasn’t: How would the Black Caps fare on tour in Pakistan. Nor was was it whether the RCCC trophies would ever be returned, although that was certainly mentioned. All the talk was who would be singled out for praise or scorn at the annual RCCC Awards.

But first, there was pints of the black stuff to be sunk and new friends from the sometimes sketchy streets of Christchurch to made at the Bog. The RCCC Wolf Pack resplendent in their number ones certainly caught the eye and several admiring glances from other patrons were noted, along with some sticker-based evidence of our last visit to the pub.

The Club last visited Delhi Belly in July 2019 with goat being a very popular option so much so that the restaurant ran out, and service scored well too. Gladly, nothing has changed on both those fronts with goat popular again – Goat Saag was pronounced to be amazing and Jalfrezi was truly excellent too. Kudos to the staff for looking after such a large group of boisterous Lads and keeping the liquid libation flowing at all times. Once the Mararajah had relieved himself of his pre-loading duties elsewhere he kicked off awards:

- Fish Slayer award – RH. Most fish caught on the Sounds trip though not enough for dinner.
- Nine and a Half award – WM. Feeding the fishes with half of his finger.
- Say What? award – TK. “Didn’t realise these write ups occurred”.
- Bill Shakespeare award – RT. For writing the write ups on the RCCC website.
- Best Dressed award – Maharajah. Representing the RCCC at the White House.

The much anticipated return of the Cricketer of the Month and FOMO trophies finally happened as their temporary owners sheepishly returned them after an extended spell. That earnt a swift re-awarding of the CoTM to IC and the FOMO was dished out to KS who promptly started a new tradition by drinking out of it. Long live the new FOMO tradition.

Scores on the Doors:

Service: 3.9/5

Food: 4.4/5

Total: 8.3/10
