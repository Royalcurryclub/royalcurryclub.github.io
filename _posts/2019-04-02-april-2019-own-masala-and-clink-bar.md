Indian Hot.

Started well with very attentive service and concern that we have beer readily available – tick. Very happy to move tables to accommodate the larger than expected audience to MD’s burning ceremony – tick. The unique onion bahjee that looked like calamari crab was delicious and the last thing MD really tasted so nice to go out on a high note – tick. The hottest vindaloo was certainly hot and the concern to MD’s general health and well being by the chef and the wait staff during the ordeal was appreciated – “it’s too hot sir” – tick. Provision of free ice cream, but only on completion of the vindaloo, in keeping with the nature of the challenge, was a beautiful touch, although melting it with MD’s vindaloo aura before MD even touched it with his spoon sent a certain RCCC fellow member running – tick. Enthusiasm to shake MD’s hand, take a photo and wish him well in lieu of missing the opportunity to have him sign a personal well being waiver, was a lovely touch to finish on – tick tick. Great night team, loved the support showed for the good cause (Gum boot Friday – I Am Hope) and for MD in the Indian Hot Vindaloo fundraising challenge.
