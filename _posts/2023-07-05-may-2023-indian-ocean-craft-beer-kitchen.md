Quiche is the new Curry?

In an apparant move to “curry” favour with one of his subjects the Maharajah agreed to a repeat visit to Indian Ocean on the promise of free booze and pretty girls in the vacinity of Craft Beer Kitchen. History does not record whether either actually eventuated, but CBK certainly does nice pint and the view over the estury is decent on a fine day, so a worthwhile place to start nevertheless.

While the Mararajah stayed home to eat quiche and suck up to the monachy, the rest of the fine fellows of the RCCC decended on Indian Oceana and proceeded to enjoy a very good evening with some cracking curry in the mix too. The moist samosa beat out the bhaji (but only just) in the favourite starter stakes while the mains were found to be well above average too. Throw in some Kingfishers and you have a great evening had by all.

In a rather dangerous and mutinous move both CoTM and FOMO tropies were awarded to the Maharajah in absentia. Next months visitation could well be a tad uncomfortable for a couple of these emboldened fellows. Time shall tell…
