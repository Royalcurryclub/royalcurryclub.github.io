Front of house staff rock.

After the September edition was turned into another stay at home episode, a number of the fine RCCC gentlemen ventured out into the virus free surrounds of Hornby in October 2021. Back in March 2020 we visited this establishment when it was under a different name and management – would it still rate as highly as it once did?

In the usual fashion, an appropriate drinking hole was visited beforehand, and this month the Hornby Working Mens Club got to host the RCCC. Barry the doorman was given instant legend status for his efforts.

Not too much feedback on the curries but the front of house staff at Saffron Spice were rated highly for joining in with the banter and making it an evening to remember.

Subtle RCCC branding was applied as another successful visitation wound down.

A couple pints back at the Hornby Working Mans Club was turned down – no doubt from too much tasty curry already onboard.
