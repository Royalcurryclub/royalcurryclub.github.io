Waiting for Kingfisher.

On a cold and stormy evening the RCCC crew assembled at Moon Under Water to shelter from the weather and share plans for the upcoming Easter long weekend. With no work the following day, spirits were high but the bar was packed so pints were slow. This was to be the theme of the night unfortunately. After comparing matching wardrobes and wishing we‚Äôd got to the pub earlier, it was a quick dash in the rain to the car and off to Bombay Butler for our 4th visitation. It was also the 4th establishment that the RCCC graced with its presence with, way back in the early days of September 2015.

While the menu could be described as succinct, the succulent options have never disappointed and the goat option is always a firm favourite. Sadly on this visitation the service had slipped from its usual standards. When 11 Kingfishers were ordered, and the fridge only had 4 ‚Äì we were in for a long wait while the local Super Liquor was raided by the staff. Even when the booze had been procured, it took an absolute age for it to be distributed. There were also protracted banquet procurement negotiations which may have slowed things down further. By the time the food eventually arrived, most members were dry again so the curries were marked down ‚Äì curry must be enjoyed with beer, its the rules! The korma was some sort of radioactive yellow and the chicken had the texture of carbon fibre. None of the rest of the meals were better than average.

To appease the rowdy and thirsty crowd the Maharajah dished out the trophies. CoTM went to MW again ‚Äì he‚Äôs having a good/bad run of those lately while recent joiner EK nabbed his first FOMO. Not a noteworthy visitation from a curry and service perspective but we at least enjoyed the beers so‚Ä¶oh wait üôÅ
