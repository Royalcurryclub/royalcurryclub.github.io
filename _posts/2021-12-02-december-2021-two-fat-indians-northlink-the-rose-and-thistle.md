Quick service and nice curry.

After the shenanigans and hilarity of the Annual Outing in late November it was back to the serious business of curry munching and beer for the December 2021 visitation. The RCCC decamped to the recently opened Northlink branch of the eponymous curry house chain, Two Fat Indians but not before risking life and limb at the world famous Rose and Thistle pub.

The speedy and efficient service was universally praised and the curry was well rated too. There was however feedback that one item on the menu would be better suited to a Chinese restaurant and also that the prices were slightly higher than expected, so work still to do for the Two Fat Indians crew.

In ground breaking decision, two absent members were jointly awarded the Cricketer of the Month award for their troubles. The Maharajah added further clarity to the rules by decreeing the COTM award could be awarded to members in absence â€“ a ruling that should have a number of members quaking in their curry stained boots for future visitations.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 3.8/5  
Food: 3.5/5  
**Total: 7.3/10**
