Hit and Miss

The easing of the two months COVID lockdown restrictions in time for the RCCCâ€™s 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration triggered an impressive turnout.

The night kicked off with table service pre-drinks at Aikmans was actually very nice, with that feeling of being looked after. It awesome to get some real face time with the esteemed RCCC members this month.

At Little India, there were mixed experiences. Staff service was hit and miss. The banquet option ordered by some members was average at best, but the non-banquet orders were good and tasty, much improved from the previous visitation five years ago.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 3.6/5  
Food: 4.3/5  
**Total: 7.9/10**
