Was a pleasure to experience the same consistently high level of service again at South of India – there were no curry auctions, just the correct dishes delivered directly to those who ordered them demonstrating that a good memory is still a skill that is honed and valued by a few top spots. The food was great, in particular the samosa was perfect, it’s not often you get one that’s got just the right amount of moisture as well as great flavour. The masala main was spot on, the only reason for not giving top marks was the Garlic and cheese somehow made 95% of the cheese magically disappear as the cheesy goodness was barely detectable, despite that one blip it was great and spice level was dead right for me as a medium man.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4.3/5  
Food: 3.8/5  
**Total: 8.1/10**
