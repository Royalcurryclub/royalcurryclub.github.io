Proper local

After a bit of a hike, Belfast was the destination for the RCCC this month. Pre-drinks were at Armadillo’s, where the locals were in high spirits and fancy hats. Leaners were lent on, handles of Speights were drained.

Onwards to the Nilesh Palace, where RCCC members were initially struck with uncertainty as it turned out the restaurant was more of a takeaway establishment. That being said, tables were pushed together, plates, cutlery, glasses and water jugs appeared, and orders placed with chef Nagendra Prasad Datt. Chef Datt, being the only one on shift that night, did a sterling job looking after the RCCC members whilst managing the steady flow of takeaway orders. The food portion sizes were generous, really very tasty and reasonably priced. All plates were enthusiastically polished off before we rolled back into Armadillo’s for Speights digestifs.
