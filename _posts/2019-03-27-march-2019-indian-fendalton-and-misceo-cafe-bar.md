RCCC Heaven!

A top month for those dozen or so of the RCCC members that made it. Cracking pre-drinks out in the early autumn sun at Misceos provided for great catch-up chats and future RCCC scheming.

After a short walk to Indian Fendalton, the RCCC were treated to a masterclass in customer service and some very delicious curries! The menu was extensive and the banquet options negotiable. Service kept the beers flowing, anticipating refill requests. After a couple of months of disappointment on the curry heat side of things, Indian Fendalton delivered; curries were delicious â€“ there was a great blend of heat and taste, with additional chili placed on the table for those of us that wanted to turn it up a notch.

Only slight blemish were the starters as they were a little on the dry side. Fix that and it would be close to perfect scores all round.

A brilliant evening once again!
