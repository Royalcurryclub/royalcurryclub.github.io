Wow wow outstanding.

With the New Zealand summer approaching fast, it seemed appropriate to head out to the bright lights and beachy sand of New Brighton for the November 2021 visitation. We had previously visited a neighbouring curry house and found it a good match for the refined palates of the RCCC members, so expectations were high for this outing.

The sunny weather and fresh air ensured a good turnout for the warm up drinks at the Penguin Arms where the locals treated us to several pool lessons and some sketchy stories. This deterred no-one and the members were starting to get settled in for a big session on the beers, when the summons came to head to the restaurant.

There were some brave calls initially for a coup d’état when it became apperant that the restaurant didn’t have a booze licence but as soon as the food started coming out, this was forgotten about. The Banquet Bros did their thing and those who hadn’t gone in with them, did regret that decision for a wee while. The banquet looked huge and was really good value for money. Comments included: Amazing food, amazing service. Long live MR our banquet saviour. The chicken something something was bloody great. <span data-sheets-userformat="{"2":513,"3":{"1":0},"12":0}" data-sheets-value="{"1":2,"2":"Amazing food, but no beers"}">Amazing food, but no beers. </span>Sh\*t hot spot.

The newest RCCC member was awarded the prestigious Cricketer of the Month award as the night at Chanakya drew to a close. The criteria seems to be rather hazy and haphazard these days but all decisions of the Maharaja are final and binding, so are best not questioned…Much belching and releasing of belts created enough space to retire back to the Penguin Arms for more beer and tall tales at the end of a fantastic evening.

The November 2021 RCCC visit was one for the ages.
