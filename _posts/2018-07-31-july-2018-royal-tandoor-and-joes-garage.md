Dinner Banquet – Satisfaction guaranteed – Yes!

Mid-Winter RCCC celebrations kicked off at Joe’s Garage on a positive note with Happy Hour beers before we made our way to the Royal Tandoor.

It was a unanimous call for the Dinner Banquet (“Satisfaction guaranteed”) at a very reasonable $28.50pp. The starters were plentiful; the samosa were a little dry, the pakora were however, a pleasant surprise. The group ordered Chicken Afghani, Chicken Dopyasa, Ginger Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo (Indian Hot) and Lamb Saagwala. The Ginger Chicken and Vindaloo were the stars of the show. The Vindaloo was superb, hot, but not immediate “burn your arse hairs off” hot. Overall a good experience, accompanied by an “India del Mar” soundtrack, with the best value for money banquet we can remember only slightly let down by the expensive bottles of Kingfisher.

Joe’s Garage was closed for post dinner drinks so we invited ourselves into Chillingword Road for further refreshment.

Great effort from group this month. Members significantly lifted their game in terms of secret Santa presents (no more books about afluenza). There were winners and losers though in the final wash-up (with members surprised at how popular an origami book was). Shout out to Trevor for providing the erect Santa hats.
