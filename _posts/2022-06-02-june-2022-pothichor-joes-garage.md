And Now for Something Completely Different.

After sampling Nepalese fare last month, it was back to more familiar culinary territory with a visit to Pothichor in June 2022 for the finest offerings from the state of Kerala. But first it was time to visit Joes Garage for some liquid libation and discussions of conventional vs weedless propellers on power boats.

Initial impressions of Pothichor were a little underwhelming, and not helped by discontented murmurings from the thirstier members as it became obvious we had another Pepper Bridge situation. However, we have learned in our 7 year curry quest, that is best not to judge a curry house by its decor/lack of booze licence. Our resident Southern Indian expert MD was drafted in to guide the rest of the RCCC throng through the rather succinct menu. Thankfully the owner of the establishment rescued all of us and ordered a selection of succulent starters and mains from the menu. The service was very prompt and the advice we received was absolutely spot on. The Kerala Parotta with beef curry was noted as truly exceptional but to be fair, all the dishes we had were very good and quite different from the usual fare. Even our resident Jalfrezi connoisseur got over the “no Jalfrezi” jitters and was heard to talk about the meal in glowing terms afterwards. In the spirit of trying new things there was also much mixing of various dips and sauces by members who fancied themselves as Master Curry Chefs. The good people at Pothichor can rest easy though, the originals ones tasted the best.

A couple members also made plans to revisit Pothichor for takeaways so the tastes and textures of Kerala certainly made for a pleasant and memorable visitation, and the RCCC will certainly be back. The holder of the RCCC silverware wasn’t present this month which made handing out the awards at the end of the night very easy – well done IC for retaining the trophies for another month!
