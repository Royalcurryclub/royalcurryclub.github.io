Middle of the road.

Great location, awesome decor and service was top notch. Its a pity that the food let them down otherwise I would have given more stars. I did bump them up one star because the beers were $8 a pint of Kingfisher which is outstanding for a pint in town, especially after paying $14 for not even a full pint of craft beer at the Pink Lady just before. Loved the mural of an Indian god riding two Brahman cows with a cobra around his neck

Scores on the Doors:  
Service: 4.0/5  
Food: 3.5/5
