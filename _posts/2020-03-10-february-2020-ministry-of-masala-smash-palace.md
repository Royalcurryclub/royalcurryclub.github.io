Calendar clash.

In a true celebration of multiculturalism on this the most significant of New Zealand holidays, 4 imports and 1 Kiwi celebrated Waitangi Day with excellent curry and some beers. The re-branded curry house (previously visited in May 2016) definitely delivered on service and spice!

Scores on the Doors:
