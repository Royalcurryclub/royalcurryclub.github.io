Great awards! Another cracking night!

The evening got off to nice start with pre-drinks at Civil &amp; Naval; wafts of coffee roasting smells from across the street, late afternoon warm sun and good beer.

After the short stroll to the restaurant, the Banquet Bros were excited to see that Everest had a good banquet option â€“ the Everest Mixed Platter was excellent, the lamb seekh kebab, chicken tikka, vegetable samosas (nice and moist, which is rare amongst a samosa), onion bhajees were pretty bang on, and the cheeky pakoras and spiced cauliflower florets were a nice touch. The Everest Chicken Curry and Jahlfezi were also excellent, however the lamb Lajabab was reported to be too fatty. Service was attentive and flexibility on the contents of the buffet always pleases the Banquet Bros.

The Annual Awards were well deserved this year. Post drinks were at the Eruption, where pints were enjoyed at the roof top with spectacular sunset views. Great way to sign off 2019!
