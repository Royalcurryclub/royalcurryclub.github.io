Instant classic – must go back soon.

One of the best ‘Banquet Bros’ experience. Good service, flexible on the banquet offerings, starters ok, curries fantastic. Lamb Nawabi (particularly!), Lamb Rogan Josh and Beef Madras were very well received. Hard to beat next door Pierside Cafe &amp; Bar happy hour $10 jugs pre-drinks.

Scores on the Doors:  
Service – 4.2/5
